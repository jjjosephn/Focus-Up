# Focus-Up
When it comes down to studying, students have a hard time focusing their attention on what needs to be done. This pomodoro app helps students to resist those urges to go off task and helps train the brain to focus. Within this app, each pomodoro (study session) is 25 minutes long with a 5 min break in between, and every third break is 15 minutes long. These time lengths will help students to not procrastinate, but instead help them to become more productive with a sense of urgency to complete one task at a time.
